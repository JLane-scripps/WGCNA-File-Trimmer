# The ReadMe

This executable (and its corresponding python file) is a very simple (somewhat ugly) tool 
to benefit the researcher using WGCNA (weighted gene co-expression network analysis), 
specifically the MetaNetwork ( https://github.com/avcarr2/MetaNetwork/tree/master ). 

The program has two main functions: The first being Remove Blanks, the second being Remove Insignificance. Details on these later. 

Presently, it is possible any PC running this executable may require the installation of "openpyxl", an engine used to read and write the Excel files. 
The program will alert you of this when running the executable and attempting to use either function.
Hopefully Pip is already installed , and the user may merely install openpyxl:
  Windows + R to open the "Run" tool > enter "cmd" without quotations to open Command Prompt > type "pip install openpyxl" without quotes, hit enter. 
If Pip is not installed, please google how to do so; it's not difficult but updated guides will be more useful than my eventually-dated explanation here. 

# Remove Blanks:
This function is useful for formatting data BEFORE entering files into the WGCNA MetaNetwork. MetaNetwork does not handle blank values well, crashing 
mid-job or attributing incorrect values; therefore it is necessary to remove all rows that contain blank values before running the analysis. Note that 
entering 0's for all blanks may affect data integrity and give very incorrect results. This function copies the original input dataframe, removes each 
row (usually the entire protein) containing no value (blank cells), and saves the result as a new file. File names are automatically generated from the 
original file's name with an appended "blanks_removed" -- no original data is altered or lost. Files are found using the "Find File" button opening 
user directory. The console will print contracted versions of the dataframe ater it is read and after it is adjusted.
  Known Issue*: If two or more columns share the same name, each duplicate will have a ".X" appended to them where X = the number of duplicates. 

# Remove Insignificance
This function is useful for formatting data AFTER a WGCNA MetaNetwork analysis has been run, and the results have been downloaded.
It takes in the "gProfiler_Enrichment_Results." file* which should have one sheet per module created by the MetaNetwork. 
Again, to avoid data loss or alteration, each sheet is copied in (and again printed to console), filtered to keep only rows marked 
as TRUE in the 'significant' column* (marked as significant by the MetaNetwork parameters) and concatenated all to the same new dataframe. 
The console shows the number of rows marked significant in each sheet, which may be useful to you.
  Note*: Currently MetaNetwork generates these gProfiler names with a period at the end. This program does not add it and doesn't adjust it.
  Note*: TRUE in these Excel cells is a boolean, not a string.
Rows are marked by which sheet (aka which color module) they came from in a new column added to the end.
The function then removes all rows with Term_ID's appearing more than once. It removes duplicates AND the first to appear in the dataset. 
This leaves only truly unique and significant results. The file is saved with the original file's name + "_significants"* next to the original.
  Note*:  No I don't mean "significance", i mean the results that are significant. 

# Executable
The executable file will be recreated and uploaded with any changes.
I do not work for the WGCNA developers or the MetaNetwork developers or their team. I will not know the answers to MetaNetwork questions.
If any issues arise with this program, please leave a comment or message this github and I will attempt to fix it. Thanks!
